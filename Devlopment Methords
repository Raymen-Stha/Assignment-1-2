Development Methodology
Methodology: Agile Methodology chosen
Development of Pet Adoption Portal will use the Agile methodology; Visual Studio/ALM2013-VS 11 introduces Agile project management, where the iterative and incremental development will maintain flexibility to make changes during entire life-cycle of a software.

Justification:
Change friendly: The agile model is open to any last-minute changes at a later stage in the project so that it helps us move freely for new requirements or feedbacks.
Incremental and continuous approach to development: the project will be built in small, incremental manageable slices (in sprints) so that feedback from stakeholders can check progress early convincing.
Benefits of Collaboration and Communication within the Team: Agile encourages teamwork which results in better collaboration between all team members that everyone understands what needs to be done! (Daily stand-ups) to help coordinate and problem-solve.
