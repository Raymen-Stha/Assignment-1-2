Problem Statement

Real world problem Description:
The existing pet finding and adopting procedure is tough as well lengthy. Potential adopters are forced to visit multiple shelters, navigate differing websites and ultimately deal with a confusing amount of information. It is these factors that make it hard to get the right pet, which in turn leads to frustration and people dropping out of the adoption process.

How the Web-Information System Solved The Issue:
Through the Pet Adoption Portal, all our users will have a single destination from which they can view pets in an aggregated fashion across various sources, learn more about their stories and ultimately begin this process of adoption online. An app that will pull all pets together, managed with the latest information (updated list), among other features like user account and animal registration to ease of use in adopting.
